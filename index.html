     <h1>Where I am From</h1>
         <p>I was born in San Jose California.I was born on August 28,2001 , I am currently 14 years old and enjoy listening to music. I like to listen to Justin Bieber, 21 Pilots, Bring Me The Horizon, and Eminem.When I get older I want to become a doctor, the reason I want to become a doctor is because my aunt is a doctor and I want to be like her. She is a great influence in my life. </p>
 
 <h1>What I Do Now</h1>
 <p>I currently attend Alpha Cindy Avitia highschool. I am currently a freshman. I help out at brother and sisters school, which is also a charter school and functions somewhat like ours. Some similarities are that we have are our rules, having to wear uniform.</p>
